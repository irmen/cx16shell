## Compiling the shell

You'll need a very recent Prog8 compiler to build this from source.

First type ``git submodule update --init`` to fetch the external modules. 
Then just type ``make`` to compile the shell.
Type ``make emu`` to compile, copy everything to the correct folders on the sdcard,
and immediately start it in the Commander X16 emulator.

Save SHELL.PRG as AUTOBOOT.X16 to the sd-card to automatically load and run the shell at startup.


## Usage

Type "help" at the prompt to get a list of the built-in commands.

You can also type the name of an "external command" program, located in the "SHELL-FILES/commands" subdirectory.
Finally you can simply type the name of a program to launch (no file extension required, case-insensitive).
"man", "time" (and "date"), "view" and "neofetch" are available amongst others, as some potentially useful external commands.

You can use tab for filename completion (case-sensitive).

## Startup config script and running user scripts

If a "config.sh" script file exists in the SHELL-FILES subdirectory, this will be loaded and executed
at startup. Every line will be executed as a shell command. Empty lines or lines starting with a '#' will be skipped.
The default config.sh file contains a bunch of command aliases, sets the screen mode and changes the color scheme,
and prints a welcome message. You can change the script however you like.

Actually, any file ending with ".sh" is treated as a shell-script, in ISO character encoding,
that contains lines with shell instructions. You can execute it just by typing its full name.
Scripts existing in the "SHELL-FILES/commands" directory will be executed first.

NOTE: currently the length of a script is limited to 1 KB (not enforced). If your script exceeds this
it will overwrite program memory when loaded and cause havoc on the system.


## External commands

The shell can launch 'external commands' much like a Unix shell runs programs from disk.
You can write those commands yourself, they have to adhere to the following API.

Command should be assembled from address $4000 and up (to max $9f00).
They should be stored in the ``SHELL-FILES/commands`` subdirectory on your sdcard.

Utility routines you can call from your command program::

    romsub $07d9 = txt_color(ubyte colortype @A) clobbers(A)       ; activate one of the 5 color types (constants defined below)
    romsub $07dc = version() -> uword @AY               ; returns pointer to string with shell's version
    romsub $07df = get_text_colors() -> uword @AY       ; returns address of array of 5 text color bytes (text, background, highlight, prompt, error)
    romsub $07e2 = chrout(ubyte character @A)
    romsub $07e5 = print(str string @AY) clobbers(A,Y)
    romsub $07e8 = print_ub(ubyte value @ A) clobbers(A,X,Y)
    romsub $07eb = print_ubhex(ubyte value @ A, bool prefix @ Pc) clobbers(A,X,Y)
    romsub $07ee = print_ubbin(ubyte value @ A, bool prefix @ Pc) clobbers(A,X,Y)
    romsub $07f1 = print_uw(uword value @AY) clobbers(A,Y)
    romsub $07f4 = print_uwhex(uword value @ AY, bool prefix @ Pc) clobbers(A,Y)
    romsub $07f7 = print_uwbin(uword value @ AY, bool prefix @ Pc) clobbers(A,Y)
    romsub $07fa = input_chars(uword buffer @ AY) clobbers(A) -> ubyte @Y
    romsub $07fd = err_set(str message @AY) clobbers(A,Y)

Command receives arguments at $0:BF00 (zero terminated, see  https://github.com/X16Community/x16-docs/blob/66e2cdcf6abaf00da45d0a00b7bed310319586f0/X16%20Reference%20-%2008%20-%20Memory%20Map.md#bank-0)
(you can use the cx16.get_program_args routine to retrieve them)
Command should return error status in A. You can use the ``err_set()`` routine to set a specific error message for the shell.
Command CAN use the *free* zero page locations.
Command CANNOT use memory below $4000 (the shell program itself sits there).
Command CAN use Golden Ram $0400-up to where the jump table starts (see above). 

The "ext-command.p8" source file contains a piece of example Prog8 source code of an external command.


## Todo

- fix the nmi zp variable to survive after calling external programs (put it in array so it stays out of ZP?)
- make the 'help' command list out the available commands more nicely (table columns?)
- add an option to 'echo' to not output a newline at the end.
- need more manpages written.
- add a 'play' external command for .zsm and .zcm files (using zsmkit)
- load .sh scripts in a ram bank instead of golden ram to avoid program corruption when script > 1KB
- new memory layout? Shell program at the top of memory (say $6000-$9f00) so that you can load regular programs at $0801? What about the external commands? No longer forced to start at $4000 but just regular programs?
