@hls@n displays contents of the current directory

@eSYNTAX:
@p$@n ls @p[pattern]

@eEXAMPLES:
@p$@n ls
  @hlists all files in the current directory

@p$@n ls *.sh
  @hlists all shell scripts in the current directory

@hNOTE:@n Unlike a @hPOSIX@n compliant @hls@n, @eyou can't display contents of subdirectories@n with this command. Instead, you need to @pcd@n into the subdirectory and then run @pls@n. This is a case due to a limimited file IO API provided by CX16.
